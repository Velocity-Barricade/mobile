# Barricade: De-centralized AI-based face recognition attendence system

### Problem
In Pakistan, 37% of government doctors are absent in hospitals. Our MNA's are found marking proxies of their fellow politicians in Assembly's attendence register.
Where 2.5 million children are not in school, thousands of ghost schools are making matters worse. These are schools that either exist on paper only, have a building that's being used for another purpose, or being left to dilapidate because 29% of government teachers are not showing up to schools but are marked present in school register and get paid by the government for nothing (THAT'S CORRUPTION!).
Across the country, more and more university students are missing so many classes that they are academically at risk. With our country suffering from a considerably low literacy rate, the country’s youth is busy showing a non-serious attitude towards education, which is evident from their habit of bunking off their classes in educational institutions.

### Solution 
So to address the absenteeism, proxy culture and corruption issue in Pakistan, we present “THE BARRICADE” - Solving Chronic Absenteeism: A Problem Hidden in Plain Sight, through AI.

# Run the App
There are two ways you can install this application on your device.

1. [Build the project by cloning this repositry.](https://github.com/Velocity-Barricade/mobile) OR
2. [Download the APK file.]()

# What the Barricade does
## Solves the Problem of Intentional Absenteeism:
By automating the attendance system, not only through an AI-based face recognition but a proxy security check to ensure that you aren't marking proxy of your friend. 
## Prevents Unintentional Absenteeism:
By displaying students, the daily schedule of the classes along with time and venue. The app will notify the student, moments before their scheduled classes about the class and venue, to never be late again! While it is preferable to attend all lectures, sometimes, missing classes is unavoidable. And, for that purpose, our app also gives the option to students to track the classes of the same course in the next slot, so that they can't miss the lecture the same day. Once your timetable is added, you can add your campus friends to the app via email to find out when you and your friends share common free time together.
## Security Check
A unique session is created by the teacher and a QR code is brought by the teacher. This session QR code that is designed to expire in a fixed duration, so, for instance, it will expire during the duration of the class and then no one can mark their attendance. Which brings us to how the attendance is actually marked. A student simply opens the application and navigates to the attendance management tab. The attendance management tab opens the camera, and the individual scans the QR code which then automatically switches the camera to the front-facing camera which detects the face and sends the image to the server for further processing. This processing is done within a second and the attendance gets marked.The entire process is automated and proxy-proof because the model has been trained in a way so that it can not be tricked by a picture.  

Moreover, it also provides a list of your upcoming commitments, meetings or classes, all on one screen, so that you have your entire planned out efficiently.

# Scalability
This application will attempt to challenge the status-quo by tearing down the walls of the current system and introducing a culture of accountability, not only in education sector but also in health and government sectors as well, with an aim to improve performance across the board, without any human intervention in between, so as to remove all biases.

Right now, we are more focused on this app to get mature in education section. Once done, we aim to launch this app for government sectors and heath sectors as well.
